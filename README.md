# top_movies
This Flask app lets users manage a local movie database, adding, editing, and deleting details. Integrated with The Movie Database (TMDb) API, it retrieves movie info like titles, descriptions, and poster images. The app uses Flask for routing, SQLAlchemy for database management, and Flask-WTF for form handling and validation.
